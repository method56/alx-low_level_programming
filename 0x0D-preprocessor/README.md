In computer programming, a directive or pragma is a language construct that specifies how a compiler should process its input Preprocessing directives are lines in your program that start with #. The # is followed by an identifier that is the directive name. For example, #define is the directive that defines a macro. Whitespace is also allowed before and after the #. The # and the directive name cannot come from a macro expansion
